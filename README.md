# Image Processing Library (C++)

## Description
This image processing library, written in C++, provides tools for analyzing and modifying digital images. It leverages object-oriented design for organized image management, making it ideal for applications in image processing and computer vision.

## Features

- **Image Filtering:**
  - **Convolutional Filter:** Supports applying a mask for image transformation.
  - **Mask Filter:** Enables the use of specific masks for detailed processing.
  - **Negative Filter:** Creates the negative of the image.
  - **Gamma Correction Filter:** Adjusts the image brightness using a gamma parameter.
  - **Statistic Filter:** Extracts statistical data from regions of the image, such as mean value and variance.

## Installation

To install the library, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iraklisspyrou/Image_Processing_Library.git

2. Open the project in **Visual Studio** and build the project.

## Usage

Sample code, usage examples and corrupted images for testing errors are included within the project. You can test the image processing functions and experiment with the filters.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio 2017 or newer
- C++ compiler
